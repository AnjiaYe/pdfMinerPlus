# pdfMinerPlus 

Welcome to the pdfMinerPlus repository! This project focuses on developing an application for a Hybrid Semi-Automated Workflow for Systematic and Literature Review Processes with Large Language Model Analysis.

"Prompting is an art. You will likely need to try a few different approaches for your prompt if you donâ€™t get your desired outcome the first time."

## Use Cases

Test your prompts with articles today:

- [Microsoft Edge with built-in PDF reader and Copilot](https://microsoft.com/edge): This tool will help you get started by testing your prompt and easy to make changes. Utilize our identifier, verifier, and data field prompts to extract structured information from PDFs.
  Use instruction: "Act as a researcher, answer from this page. Structure the extracted information as a JSON. Use "NA" if information is not found. JSON Fields:"

- [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com): Use Gemini Pro 1.5 models within Google AI Studio for title/abstract screening.
  1. Retrieve title and abstract: For example, Endnote 21: Select reference - File - Export. Make sure you select following output style:

  2. Use Gemini Pro to extract data from abstracts: Create a new chat in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat). Use instruction:"Act as a researcher, extract the following information from context consist of titles and abstracts. Structure the extracted information as a JSON. Use "NA" if information is not found. JSON Fields:". Copy/Upload your txt file to the chat. You also need to use following settings for the LLM.

  3. Convert to CSV: Copy outputs to a [JSON editor](https://jsoneditoronline.org/). Save - Export to CSV - Save to disk.
     
  4. Use MS Excel to process data as described in our paper.
 

## Collaboration Opportunities

We are open to collaboration and welcome researchers interested in testing the prototype application. If you are interested in participating, please contact us directly at [anjia.ye@utas.edu.au](mailto:anjia.ye@utas.edu.au).

## What's Next 

The project currently hosts a prototype web application designed to support the described workflow. We are actively working on developing a more user-friendly version for public release. Stay tuned for updates!
