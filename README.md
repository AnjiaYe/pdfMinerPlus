# pdfMinerPlus 

Welcome to the pdfMinerPlus repository! This project focuses on developing an application for a Hybrid Semi-Automated Workflow for Systematic and Literature Review Processes with Large Language Model Analysis.

"Prompting is an art. You will likely need to try a few different approaches for your prompt if you donâ€™t get your desired outcome the first time."

## Current Status

The project currently hosts a prototype web application designed to support the described workflow. We are actively working on developing a more user-friendly version for public release. Stay tuned for updates! 

## Collaboration Opportunities

We are open to collaboration and welcome researchers interested in testing the prototype application. If you are interested in participating, please contact us directly at [anjia.ye@utas.edu.au](mailto:anjia.ye@utas.edu.au). By participating, you agree to share input prompts and outputs to help further develop this project.  

## Use Cases

Test your prompts with articles today with:

- [Microsoft Edge with built-in PDF reader and Copilot](https://microsoft.com/edge): This tool will help you get started by testing your prompt and easy to make changes. Utilize our identifier, verifier, and data field prompts to extract structured information from PDFs.
